        <h1 id="Information">Egan Vickers</h1>
        <p>My name is Egan Vickers, and I am a second year GIMM student who has been working to improve my skills in a
          variety of fields relating to coding, design, and as a teammate. I have ambitions to learn about a variety of
          fields relating to sound, including sound design and foley. While this may be my primary target for learning,
          I strive to be proficient in all fields in order to be helpful in all ways with those I work with. In the
          following parts of this page, I will discuss and show different parts of my career so far in what I've worked
          on and thoughts of the time on why I made certain design decisions.</p>

        <p>When I started in GIMM, I had no experience with any form of coding or design. This was frustrating at the
          start,
          given that most the projects we worked on required content that wasn't necessarily taught during lectures.
          This led
          to me figuring out different solutions to problems in unconventional or inefficent ways due to my lack of
          knowledge.
          The best example of this is my first individual game project I worked on, Nebula.</p>

    <h1 id="Nebula">Nebula</h1>
    <p>This was the first game I created by myself, and your objective was to survive as long as you could in an
      infinite hallway while matching the colors of the walls that came towards you. It was a simple concept, and
      largely took inspiration from games like Jetpack Joyride. Looking back, there was so many ways I could've
      improved the coding as I used hexcodes in the code to match the player's color and the walls color (allowing
      you to pass through), but I'm still happy with the way it came out.</p>

        <p>Another example I'll use is one of the projects I worked on with in a group of four people (including me).
          The details of this project was the we needed to make a interactive comic book game, using the panels of the
          comic to transfer into different levels. In addition, we were given a concept that the game needed to be based
          around. With this is mind, this was quite the fun project to work on. One large learning experience that I
          took away from this was that ambition is good, but it must be tempered by deadlines and realistic outcomes.
          This was significant as this project went through many iterations and design ideas, most of which I worked
          with a fellow classmate to design. Eventually, I had to step up into a semi-leadership position, giving
          deadlines and directions for what to work on. For myself personally, I worked on multiple parts of this
          project, such as parts of the art, level design, core mechanics, and overview.</p>
